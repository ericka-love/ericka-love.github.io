            Immigration in the United States is always a topic of conversation. Especially so during big election years. The word immigration is usually a buzzer word, during debates and conversations around potential political candidates. immigration in the United States is always up for debate because many states along the border view it as a large effect on the economy, agriculture, jobs and overall welfare of a state. For many politicians, the large influx of immigrants from South American countries, the Caribbean and Mexico brings on an onslaught of racial and ethnic bias and uneducated perceptions of people of color. For immigrants who come through the United States through other avenues and other borders, that bias is not experienced as evidently. 
            
            This time last year Governor Greg Abbott of Texas, shipped thousands of immigrants from the Texas borders to metropolitan cities like Washington DC, New York city, Los Angeles, and Seattle. The goal of this was to “punish” politicians in that area who favor immigration and challenge their perceptions around how hard it is to assimilate immigrants into an established culture. This was also a dig at President Biden for his lack of thoughtful decision making around how to treat, vet, and essentially welcome immigrants into the United States through the southern border.

            Due to COVID and many other factors, the situation at the border has halted but also resulted in many deaths amongst women and children who have tried to continue to come into the United states. Just last year over 687 people died at the border due to the aggressive acts of Texas state border patrol, lack of resources and gang related activity.  As seen in The chart below, the majority of immigrants reside in California, Texas, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. The majority of this reasoning is because of the Southern border, but also due to the shipment of humans as if they are Commodities to other larger cities in the United states. Vice President Kamala Harris urged Governor Abbott to think otherwise on his actions towards these human beings. Most times immigrants were not shipped with their own items, nor were they provide

          Dr. Fethi Keles, a professor of practice at Syracuse University teaching The history and culture of Islam and the Middle Eastern world, says that his experience immigrating to the United States was very positive in terms of acceptance amongst the upstate New York community. but he recognizes the significant differences of brown people who look like him who are coming from countries in the southern region of the world. I was an immigrant from Turkey, he had the privilege to learn English from a young age and understand the United States long before immigrating here. He recognizes that that is not the reality for most immigrants and that something as fundamental as learning the language can take years and many opportunities to be assimilated into the culture to understand the nuance.

          As more research is done, the rhetoric around immigrants has changed. the majority of immigrants are no longer Mexican nationals. Many of the immigrants coming through the southern border are coming from South America fleeing violence, persecution or corruption in their state governments. The US is steadily moving away from conservative views on immigrants and how they serve the communities they live in, but it is still very unclear where they are and who they are due to the limits around checking for citizenship.

          In states like Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis has abused his right on a federal level to check for legal citizenship amongst black and brown people who live in the state of florida. in States like new york, immigrants have been shipped around like produce, due to the lack of space in the city and housing crisis. On the West Coast, politicians are still battling with domestic homelessness and how to account for immigrants who desire jobs but otherwise can't afford housing.

                  Right now there are no bills in Congress that address immigration. Many legislators cannot find a middle ground that achieves multiple goals for multiple people. Many Northeastern states are welcoming immigrants and are promoting themselves as sanctuaries for people who otherwise feel left out. But for many other states in the South and Midwest, it is hard to negotiate reasonable resources that can be provided without compromising other priorities like legislation around gun safety, welfare and healthcare for current American citizens.

                  These factors directly influence the conversations had on Capitol Hill around immigrants and how to best support them. It is still unclear what federal actions will be taken against the state of Texas and Governor Greg Abbott for the actions done last year.
